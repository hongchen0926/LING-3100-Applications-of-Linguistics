# LING-3100-Applications-of-Linguistics

This repository hosts the public lecture materials for LING 3100 Applications of Linguistics offered in Fall 2021 at Georgia Tech. 
The lecture slides and syllabus were developed from the teaching materials made by Dr. Lelia Glass (https://www.leliaglass.com/teaching). Along with the lecture slides, this folder also inclues class reflection questions that were used for student discussion board, and a list of articiles which students chose from to do their class presentation and two paper reviews.
