# LING-3100-Applications-of-Linguistics

This repository hosts the lecture materials for LING 3100 Applications of Linguistics offered in Fall 2021 at Georgia Tech, taught by Hongchen Wu. 
This course (which satisfies an Institute-wide Humanities requirement) explores the relation of language (and linguistic theories) to real-world domains including but not limited to language learning, education, gender, advertising, politics, law, and medicine. It turned out we had some time to talk about Language and Biology for a bit at the end.

The lecture slides and syllabus as well as list of articles were developed from the teaching materials made by Dr. Lelia Glass (https://www.leliaglass.com/teaching). Along with the lecture slides and syllabus, this folder also inclues class reflection questions that were used for student discussion board on Canvas, and a list of articles which students chose from to do their class presentation and two paper reviews. As the number 100 is such a cool number, the list of articles managed to reach the number 100 at the end.

One of the course assignments was **writing two paper reviews**. Students can choose a paper from the given list of reading materials and a paper beyond the list. Paper review samples were provided. This open-ended assignment turned out to be an assignment that students really like since a lot of them consider such freedom of choosing topics to work on as one of the best aspects of the course. Below is a list of top 5 papers chosen by studnets to do their first paper reviews on.
- Pokémonastics: a study in sound symbolism and Pokémon names
- What’s in a Brand Name? A Note on the Onomastics of Brand Naming
- No Country for Old Members: User Lifecycle and Linguistic Change in Online Communities
- Evidence that Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality
- Analyzing the Language of Food on Social Media

Another well-accepted asisgnment is the final project presentation, which was organized in the format of **5 Minute Blitz Talk Competition**. Students need to present in 5 MINUTES with only 1 PowerPoint slide. The goal is for students to engage all their communication skills to make your presentation vivid and engaging while emphasizing its key point without too much technical terminology or field-specific jargon. 
Below is a list of the top five presentations based on the votes by students in the class (the last two projects in this list got the same number of votes).
- Analyzing different language used to describe white and black NFL players by commentators and analyst
- Evaluating ASL Translation Datasets & Models for Fairness
- Natural Language Processing and Social Media
- Framing on Video Game Performance
- Chomsky Hierarchy of Grammars
- THE STORY OF OJ: How can linguistics change the outcome of a court case?

On November 10, 2021, the class was very pleased to have Dr. Hadas Kotek to give a talk titled "Linguistics in Tech". Below is a refelction essay written by a student after attending this talk and the student has granted me permission to share it. 

*On November 10, I attended the “linguistics in tech” by Dr. Hadas Kotek virtually with the class. As a Computer Science major, she opened my eyes to how linguists play an important role in the modern technology industry, especially in the NLP field. She told us what the available career paths as a linguist are. Furthermore, we did some activities with her virtually. I have learned that what linguistics contributes to what we have now, for example, virtual assistance, is vital, and it is not the kind of work anyone can do. I used to think that anyone could do the data annotation work that she mentioned in the presentation. In fact, it is not true. It requires rich knowledge in linguistics because what they do is content-dependent. The linguist’s work is not the type of job which one rule applies to all. I have learned although we are all proficient in at least one language, it does not mean that we know enough to teach computers to understand and use the language. Teaching computer a language requires a deeper understanding of linguistic and is harder than teaching a 3-years old to use a language.

Special thanks go to Dr. Lelia Glass for generously sharing her teaching materials on this course; without her help, the class would not be as smooth as it was in the Fall 2021. Many thanks to Dr. Hadas Kotek who gave us a great talk. I'd also like to thank Dr. Omer Preminger, Dr Bronwyn Bjorkman, Dr. Freddy Hu, Dr. Elyse Graham, Grace Wivell and Joanne Jingwen Li for their wonderful suggestions and input; they referred me to wonderful resources when I prepared for this course. As always, all errors in materials shared in this folder are mine.
